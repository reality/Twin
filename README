Script to copy KVM-QEMU virtual machines from one physical server to another at
a reasonable interview, keeping a slightly lagged mirror of the virtual machine
in another physical server. Designed for quick switch-over to a working version
of a website on the occasion of breakage, it also checks that the VM is working
and responding before it replaces the old running backup, thereby not
overwriting a running backup with a broken copy.
